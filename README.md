# Getting Started with Angular 11 Stock Chart

The [Angular Stock Chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/angular-components/angular-stock-chart?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=angular-stock-chart-github-samples) is a well-crafted, easy-to-use financial charting package to track and visualize stock price of any company over a specific period using charting(such as Candlestick, OHLC, HiLo, etc.) and range tools. It also comes with a lot of features such as zooming, panning, tooltip, crosshair, trackball, period selector, range selector, and events to make the stock charts more interactive.

## Features and Benefits of Angular Stock Chart Component

### High performance
Several data-rendering optimizations are included for the best possible performance when plotting large volumes of data and handling high-frequency real-time data.

### Interactive Chart
The end-user experience is greatly enhanced by including a set of interactive features such as zooming, and panning, crosshair, trackball, events, and selection.

### Multiple series
Plot multiple series in a single chart to compare different stock values. Enabling a legend and a tooltip gives more information about an individual series.

### Range selector
Use the range selector to filter a date range for data that needs to be visualized.

### Series type
Visualize data using different series types like candle, OHLC, HiLo, line, spline, area, and spline area. The series type can be changed using the series options in the period selector.

### Trendlines
Predict future trends with predetermined data for any measurement such as the stock market or target revenue with the help of trendlines. You can add trendlines to a stock chart using the trendlines options in the period selector.

### Stock events
Stock events are used to show different kinds of market events on the chart. Use a flag, sign, pin, text, circle, or description.

### Localization
Based on their needs, users can localize all the strings that are used in the user interface of the Angular Stock Chart component. It uses the localization (l10n) library to localize UI strings.
